= Searching in upplay

Upplay supports two search modes:
 
- Inside the current directory page: this is handy to quickly skip inside
  a long list.
- Server search.

The search panel is located at the bottom of the library window (the one on
the right), and normally hidden. You can open it by the following actions:
 
- Typing `/` inside the library window.
- Typing `Ctrl+f` inside the library window.
- Using the View menu

Not all servers support search (e.g, MediaTomb does not, Minidlna does,
etc.).

You can close the panel by the following actions:

- Typing `Esc` (the Escape key).
- Clicking the x-cross icon on the right of the panel
- Using the `View` menu.

When the search panel opens for the first time, the panel is in local
search mode. Typing inside the search entry area will try to find matches
in the page. You can use the two arrow buttons or type `F3` or `Shift+F3`
to find the next or previous match.

In server mode, the search panel will let you enter a search string and the
kind of field inside which you want to search (the combobox on the right,
Artist/Album/Title). Type `Enter` or click the search button to start the
search. 

The results are displayed just like a directory listing and can be
used in the same way (including opening tabs for directory listings, etc.).

Server searches are always relative to the first directory earlier in the
path, never to another search.
If your search yields nothing, one of the things to check is that you are
high enough in the tree (not searching a single directory).

Also *_space characters are significant in the search entry_*. This has a
capacity for trouble but it can also be a great help when trying to match
words (there are no standard UPnP ways to specify word matches, or anchor a
search at the beginning or end of a field).
