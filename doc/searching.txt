= Searching in upplay

Upplay supports two search modes:
 
- Inside the current directory page: this is handy to quickly skip inside
  a long list.
- Classic UPnP search on the server.

The search panel is located at the bottom of the library window (the one on
the right), and normally hidden. You can open it by the following actions:
 
- Using the View menu
- Typing '/' inside the library window.
- Typing 'Ctrl+f' inside the library window.

You can close the panel by the following actions:

- Using the View menu.
- Typing 'Esc' (the Escape key).

By default, the panel is in local search mode. Typing in the search entry
will try to find matches in the page. You can use the two arrow buttons or
type F3 or Shift+F3 to find the next or previous match.

If the currently displayed page comes from an UPnP Media Server which
supports searching (not all do), you can switch the panel to server search
by checking the _Server Search_ checkbutton. You can also toggle between
local and server modes by typing Ctl+s.

In server mode, the search panel will let you enter a search string and the
kind of field inside which you want to search (the combobox on the right,
Artist/Album/Title). Type Enter or click the search button to start the
search. The results are displayed just like a directory listing.
