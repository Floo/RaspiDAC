= Upplay - Qt-based UPnP / OpenHome audio Control Point for X11 desktops

*upplay* is a simple Qt-based UPnP/OpenHome Control Point for Unix
desktops.

It is based on the *Sayonara* local player, the UI of which was reused and
pitilessly maimed.

It supports gapless transitions using either *AVTransport* _setNextUri_ or
*OpenHome* _Playlist_, depending on what the device supports (*OpenHome* is
chosen if available).

In its current early state, upplay is quite primitive. Especially:
 
 - The Media Server Content Directory browser is a prototype which was
   quickly put together to enable the control part. It lacks most of the
   normal functions: you can only browse the tree and add tracks one at a
   time (always appending). It's also very ugly.
 - The UI needs a lot of polishing everywhere, keyboard accelerators,
   weirdness removal etc...

Still the player can be useful if you are at your desk PC with no decent
control point around, at least to turn the music off...

I would very much like some help in improving the UI ! And we need a new
logo.
