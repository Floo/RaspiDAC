== Upplay - Qt-based UPnP / OpenHome audio Control Point for X11 desktops

*upplay* is a simple Qt-based UPnP/OpenHome Control Point for Unix
desktops. link:http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upplay/[Home page].

It is based on the *Sayonara* local player, the UI of which was reused and
pitilessly maimed.

It supports gapless transitions using either *AVTransport* _setNextUri_ or
*OpenHome* _Playlist_, depending on what the device supports (*OpenHome* is
chosen if available).

In its current early state, upplay is quite primitive. Especially:
 
 - The Media Server Content Directory browser is a prototype is still
   lacking in function and is quite ugly, but it does allow individual or
   recursive inserts of tracks/directories at the usual points in the
   queue: now, after current track, at the end.
 - The UI needs a lot of polishing everywhere, keyboard accelerators,
   weirdness removal etc...

Still the player can be useful if you are at your desk PC with no decent
control point around, at least to turn the music off...

I would very much like some help in improving the UI ! And we need a new
logo.
